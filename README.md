## How it Works

In order for this application to work the user will need to use the terminal to run the program.  Here is where the user will be able to get the PORT information in order to get the localhost number to open in the browser. This can be done by runnning "node serve" in the command line.
<br><br>

<br><br>

From there, the user will need to navigate over to their brower and open up the local host listen port in order to view the page.

<br><br>

<br><br>

By doing this, the user will be able to view the opening page of the application. From there, he/she will be able to enter a new name for a burger, then click on the "Make Burger" button to create the burger. 
<br><br>

Once clicked, the created burger will be appear on the left side of the page. Along with the newly created burger, there will be a button labeled "Eat Me!" that appears to the right of the burger name.

<br><br>

Once the burger is added, the user will click the "Eat Me!" button. Doing this will move the burger from the "Make the Burger" column on the left side of the page to the "DEVOUR THE BURGER!!" column on the right side of the page.

If the user wants to view the totality of the information within the application, he/she can got to localhost:8080/api/allburgers to view the details of each added burger by I.D.
